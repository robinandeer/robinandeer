I work as a Staff Engineer at [Hedvig](https://hedvig.com) where we're building a new kind of insurance company.

My team is responsible for the online purchase journey üõçÔ∏è. We use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to build a modern, scalable and e-commerse inspired shopping experience.

Personally, I'm interested in all things Web Development - from the frontend to the backend. I find it the most exciting app platform to work with today.

You can find my blog at [robinandeer.com](https://robinandeer.com) where I write about my experiences with Web Development and other things I find interesting.
